This file will keep on to evolve to share with our community how you can get involved in the project and how to contribute.

## Contribute a Blog Post

There are several ways in which to do this.

- Via Github (if you are familiar with git, Github, and markdown)

  - Start by forking this repository
  - You can directly work on Github or add the post by working on a local copy of the repository in git
  - The blog posts folder is `_posts`
  - The post should be written in markdown
  - The image should have a dark and not too busy background as the title, description, date, and authors will be displayed against the background image in the post
  - The image should be uploaded to `assets/img` in this repository (either via git or Github)
  - The header should look like this:
 
 ```
