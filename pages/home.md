#### Join us for our very <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQ9xU1YIoccBPafiU4_aBA1bpwiO70z7PK9ZZRdDJw213Oca756ZOuf-Jpq3k6NavXP9aVfOnXMfG3s/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000" target="_blank">first informal community meetup</a> on 26 May 2021! 



_afrimapr_ started in 2020 and is funded through the [Wellcome Open Research Fund](https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/people-and-projects/grants-awarded/afrimapr-facilitating-use-spatial-data-african-public) and [Wellcome Data for Science and Health](https://wellcome.org/what-we-do/our-work/data-science-and-health-trustworthy-data-science). 

_afrimapr_ creates R building blocks and learning resources to make it easier to make data-driven maps in Africa. 

The created resources are promoted in Africa and beyond to grow a community of users and developers to maintain and improve them. 

The R building blocks will make it easier to perform spatial data management tasks that should be straightforward, but seldom are, including: summarising data by administrative regions of different levels; joining and displaying data referenced by administrative region names; access to environmental, socio-economic and health data and displaying data in static maps and interactive web applications. 

Components are designed for ease of use to target new users of R.

_afrimapr_ also develops tutorials and runs online workshops. We hope to facilitate in-person workshops in the future.
