On 9 January 2020 the _afrimapr_ project kicked off with it's first team meeting. 

Our [team][team] is 100% distributed and currently spans two continents and three countries including the 
UK, Ethiopia, and South Africa.

_afrimapr_ is lead by Dr Andy South from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and boasts a strong team of R developers, 
community builders, and researchers. Collaborators include:

- Dr Paula Moraga (Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Bath, UK)
- Dr Julie-Anne Tangena (Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, UK)
- Dr Margareth Gfrerer (Education Strategy Centre, Ethiopia)
- Dr Robin Lovelace (Leeds Institute for Transport Studies, UK)
- Haruko Nakao (Institute for Transport Studies, University of Leeds, UK)
- Anelda van der Walt (Talarify, South Africa)

The project is currently funded through the [Wellcome Trust Open Research Fund][open-fund] and runs from January to December 2020. During this time 
we aim to develop some R packages as well as teaching materials and useful documentation. We'll also run workshops in 
Liverpool, Ethiopia, Malawi, and South Africa to trial and promote the resources.
