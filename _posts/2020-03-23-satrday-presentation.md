Earlier this month _afrimapr_ was the opening presentation at [satRday Joburg 2020][satrday-jhb] in South Africa. It was wonderful to 
find out that the audience included R colleagues from other African countries like Namibia, Kenya, and the 
Democratic Republic of Congo. There was even a representative from Women in GIS Kenya [@WiGISKe][wigiske], Caroline Akoth.

The presentation attracted a lot of interest. Specifically we were asked to share the slides so that lecturers could make it available to Masters students in Economics 
and Public Health whom are working on projects where these tools might come in handy. There were also interest from participants, and 
people following the live Tweeting, to get involved.
